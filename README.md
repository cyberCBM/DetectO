DetectO with Ju(Juce)G(OpenGL)C(OpenCV)D(Dlib)
===========
Object Detection from video or Image using Juce with OpenGL and OpenCV
1) Feed images or Video to define model for objects
2) Train your own object detection models using dlib
3) Detect objects based on trained models
4) Recognize already known objects with name

Juce: Use this finest C++ framework to make front UI.

OpenGL: Use this graphics processing as mediator for openCV to Juce GL Image conversion.

OpenCV: Use Intelligence to capture objects from image or video.

Dlib: Use intelligence to generate models for object.

Initialized a time ago.

Send suggestions that can improve the detection or the algorithm you think should be implemented for detectO to make any object detection work.
